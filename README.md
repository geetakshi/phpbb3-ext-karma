phpBB Extension - Karma System
==============================
This is a karma extension for phpBB 3.1 and up. Development was started as part of the Google Summer of Code 2013. The extension allows registered board users to add or subtracts points from other users' karma scores by rating their posts. The karma scores are displayed publicly in places where user info is displayed (next to posts, on their profiles etcetera). Karma that is deemed unfair may be reported to the board moderators, who may then edit or delete the reported karma.

Tests and Continuous Integration
================================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rechosen/phpbb3-ext-karma.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rechosen/phpbb3-ext-karma)

We use Travis-CI as a continuous integration server and PHPUnit for our unit testing. See more information on the phpBB development wiki.
